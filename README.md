LLM Project

**Dataset used**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment that contains a sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

**Goal**: Do a LLM processing to analyze how travelers in February 2015 expressed their feelings on Twitter

**Project guidelines**:
